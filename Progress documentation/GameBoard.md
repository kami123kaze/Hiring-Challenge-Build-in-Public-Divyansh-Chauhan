GameBoard.vue – A Big Regret
When I started working on GameBoard.vue, I had no idea it would get this big. I just kept adding features, and before I knew it, the file had grown way beyond what I expected. Because of this, debugging became a nightmare—finding and fixing issues took way more time than it should have. In hindsight, I should have broken it down into smaller, more manageable components. Modularizing it would have saved me a lot of frustration and made the code much easier to maintain. This was definitely a learning experience, and I won’t make the same mistake in future projects.
