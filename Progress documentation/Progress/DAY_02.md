# Day 2: 
### Learning Goals  
- API Development  
  - Endpoints for game configuration  
  - User progress tracking  
  - Authentication token validation  
- Data Management  
  - Game state schemas using Pydantic  
  - Progress tracking  
  - Error handling  
- Test coverage  

### Implementation Plan  
- Set up a small FastAPI server  
- Define basic endpoints  
- Implement initial data validation with Pydantic  
 
As soon as I have a decent grasp of FastAPI, I'll design the schema and start building the application. This should leave me with 5 days to complete everything.


# 21:30 :- created a simple FastAPI server (also happened to be my first experience with python )
