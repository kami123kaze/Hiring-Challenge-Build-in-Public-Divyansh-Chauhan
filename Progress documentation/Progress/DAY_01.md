# GOAL :- Getting used to the challange stack (reading documentations,implementing small pages etc)

12:00 -I'm currently reading documentation for Vue.js and aiming to complete a simple full-stack application by tonight. After that, my next step will be designing a schema to clearly define the structure of the landing page and backend endpoints.

23:30 - completed a small todo apllication with vue to understand how it works, used composition api as well. here is the link found similarites in react and vue which was very helpful.
