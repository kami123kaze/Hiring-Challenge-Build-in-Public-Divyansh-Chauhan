## GOALS
Finalize the frontend and integrate API calls
Debug Firestore-related issues
Implement and refine game mechanics


Completed  (Day 6-7 Progress)
Completed frontend development and ensured it works with the backend
Faced Firestore and API connection bugs, but resolved them
Spent significant time on game logic and CSS, refining animations and interactions
The gameboard component alone has over 400 lines of code
The code works but is not optimized, will need refactoring later
