## Challenges (Day 5-7) ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»
These past few days were all about building the frontend, and surprisingly, it went relatively smoothly. Most of the issues came from connecting to Firestore and integrating with the backend APIsâ€”some data wasnâ€™t being fetched properly, and authentication checks needed a few fixes. But overall, nothing too major.

The biggest time-consuming tasks were the game logic and CSS, especially for the GameBoard component, which ended up with over 400 lines of code. Structuring the logic for handling user input, balancing mechanics, and rendering the UI took quite a bit of tweaking.

## Takeaways (Day 5-7) ðŸš€
The frontend is functional, but the code is a bit messy right now. Itâ€™s not written in the cleanest way, and there are definitely optimizations to be made later. But for now, it works, which is what matters. The focus was getting everything in placeâ€”polishing and refactoring can come later.
