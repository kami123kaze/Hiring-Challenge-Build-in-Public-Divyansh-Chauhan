## Challenges (Day 4-5) 🛠️
The past two days were all about building and testing API endpoints. Most of the challenges came from bugs in Firestore rules and database collections—some queries weren’t working as expected because of permission issues, and I had to tweak the rules multiple times to get them right. There were also some frustrating moments dealing with how data was structured in Firestore, which caused unexpected errors when reading and writing.

## Takeaways (Day 4-5) 📌
I spent this time making sure the backend endpoints worked properly with Firebase and Firestore. It took some trial and error, but I finally got the authentication and database rules working the way they should. I also got a better understanding of how Firestore handles roles and permissions. Debugging was a bit of a headache, but overall, things are starting to come together.
