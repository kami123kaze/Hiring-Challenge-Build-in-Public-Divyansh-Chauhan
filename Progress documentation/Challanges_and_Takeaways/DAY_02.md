## challange today :- Today’s challenge was mainly getting used to FastAPI and Python since this was my first time working with both. Coming from JavaScript, Python’s strict indentation and slightly different syntax took some getting used to. I also had to figure out how FastAPI handles routes and query parameters, which work a bit differently than what I’m used to in JavaScript or c++ frameworks.



# takeaways :-

I set up FastAPI and ran it using Uvicorn. I created basic API routes using @app.get() and @app.post(). I also worked with query parameters to filter and fetch data based on user input.

As part of this, I built a server that retrieves student data using query parameters. FastAPI's validation handled the input automatically. I also accessed the built-in interactive documentation at /docs, which allowed me to test my API endpoints directly.

So far, I’ve focused on handling queries and fetching data, but I haven’t worked with a database yet. That will be the next step.
