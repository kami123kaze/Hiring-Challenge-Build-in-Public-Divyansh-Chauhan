## Challange for the day :- To get used to the completely new stack and understand dataflow before implementing a schema(i have barely worked with any of them which is why this should prove to be an exciting challange)





# Takeaways for today:- I built this Vue application (https://github.com/kami123kaze/Todo-app-with-vue) to learn Vue so I can use it effectively in this challenge.

Vue and React share similarities, such as component-based architecture, reactivity, and a virtual DOM. However, Vueâ€™s templating syntax is more structured, while React relies on JSX.

The Composition API in Vue is somewhat similar to React Hooks so that was easy to get a hold of.

I wanted to dive deeper, but I also need to keep track of time. Now that I have a basic understanding, I'll focus on learning as I build the project.
