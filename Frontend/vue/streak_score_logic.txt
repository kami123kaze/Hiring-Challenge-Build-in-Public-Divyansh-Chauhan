1. Initialize `streak = 0` and `score = 0`
2. When a correct answer is submitted:
   - Increase `streak` by 1
   - Calculate extra points based on the streak:
     - If `streak` is 0-3 → `bonus = +1`
     - If `streak` is 5-8 → `bonus = +5`
     - If `streak` is 8-10 → `bonus = +10`
     - If `streak` is 10+ → `bonus = +15`
   - Add points based on difficulty:
     - Easy → `+1` point
     - Normal → `+5` points
     - Hard → `+10` points
     - Extreme → `+100` points
   - `score += base_points + bonus`
3. If an incorrect answer is submitted:
   - Reset `streak = 0`
   - No additional points awarded
4. Display updated `score` and `streak`
